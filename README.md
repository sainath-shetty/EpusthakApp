# Epusthak App
it is a simple App where Users can read Religious Books for free and add them to cart for future reference and delete them from cart as well.

We Developed these App without Backend entirely using concepts of Java. In my opinion the benefit of developing a App without backend is that it forces you to think not just about fetching and retreiving the data from database but you start thinking out of the box Like "How can we use Java Concepts and achieve not the same but similar results?" It requires implementing your logical thinking and concepts of Java.

So we Loved the Entire Journey of developing these App it was fun experimenting with the concepts and simultaneously designing and developing these App. Grateful!!!
